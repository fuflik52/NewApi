TACTICAL HUD — DESIGN SYSTEM GUIDE
==================================

1. CORE CONCEPT
   - Style: Military / Tactical Software.
   - Vibe: Dark, Precise, High-Contrast accents.
   - Keywords: "HUD", "Cyberpunk", "Rust", "Dark Mode".

2. COLOR PALETTE
   - Background: #0f0f0f (95% Opacity) — Almost black, lets game bleed through slightly.
   - Panels: #161616 (Fill) / #2A2A2A (Stroke) — Dark grey containers.
   - Accent Green (Success/Ready): #8FAE58

3. TYPOGRAPHY
   - Headers & Labels: 'Roboto Condensed' (Bold/700) — Compact, readable.
   - Data & Numbers: 'JetBrains Mono' (Bold/700) — Technical look for timers, prices, stats.

4. VISUAL EFFECTS (The "Secret Sauce")
   - Tech Grid: A 40x40px grid pattern overlay (stroke opacity 0.03). Adds texture.
   - Watermarks: Giant vector icons (SVG paths) placed behind content with very low opacity (0.02 - 0.04).
     Examples: Crosshair, Skull, Trophy, AK-47, Biohazard Symbol.
   - Stripes: Diagonal stripe pattern for "Blocked" or "Cooldown" states.
   - Drop Shadows: Deep shadows (dy=4, blur=12) to lift panels off the background.

5. SHAPES
   - Corners: Generally sharp or slightly rounded (rx="2" or "4").
   - Decorative Corners: "L" shaped brackets at the corners of main frames.
   - Strokes: Thin lines (1px).
